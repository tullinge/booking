Demo site at [allaktivitetsdagen.tullingelabs.se](http://allaktivitetsdagen.tullingelabs.se/login)

## Requirements

- Docker & docker-compose
- Python 3
- Python libraries (look in `requirements.txt`, can be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Google API credentials for "Google Sign-In for Websites" (see [this article](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in)).

### Environment variables

These environment variables need to be set (except the ones which have defaults) before either running the application locally or building the Docker container (deployment).

- `REDIS_HOST` - default is `localhost`
- `MYSQL_HOST` - default is `localhost`
- `MYSQL_USER` - default is `admin`
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD` - default is `do-not-use-in-production` (override this in production!)
- `MYSQL_DATABASE` - default is `booking`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - must be set manually, used for communicating with Google API.
- `GSUITE_DOMAIN_NAME` - must be set manually, used for limiting logins to a specific G Suite organization

### Instructions (running locally)

1. `docker-compose up -d`
2. `python scripts/setup_db.py`
3. `python scripts/create_admin.py`
4. `python main.py`

### Instructions (deployment)

1. Set `DOCKER_HOST` and `MYSQL_PASSWORD`
2. `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f prod.yml up -d`
3. `docker exec booking_app_1 python scripts/setup_db.py`
4. `docker exec -it booking_app_1 python scripts/create_admin.py`

## Navigating the interface

Once you got the webserver running and an initial admin account created, you can log in to the admin interface by visiting `/admin`.

Once logged in, go ahead and click `Aktiviteter` in order to create new activities.  From each activity, you can create questions that the students have to answer when choosing the activity.

Then you can move on to the `Klasser` page, where you can create school classes that will be shown to the students when they initially set up their accounts.

Finally, you can then move on to the `Elever` page in order to create new codes. Newly generated codes are anonymous, so they can be given out to any school class. When a student logs in using a code for the first time, they will be able to enter their first- and surname along with choosing their class.

When the student has the account setup, they can browse available activities, book activities, and re-book to other activities if they change their mind.
